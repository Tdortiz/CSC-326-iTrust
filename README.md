# csc326-202-Project-01

## Overview:
Over the course of a semester in Software Engineerings (CSC 326) our team performed improvements on iTrust - a program that has been worked on by previous CSC students at NCSU over the past decade. Our team competed with other teams in the class where we all completed the same requirements in order to create the best iTrust project for that semester. At the end of the semester our project was selected as best in the class after we presented our project in front of both our lab and our entire class. 

## Goal:
Use JSF (JavaServer Faces) to implement five additional use cases, refactor logging, secure SQL connections with prepared statements, implement mocking through Mockito for proper unit testing, and create a docker image. 

## Process: 
The process involved 5 iterations where our team worked in an agile environment. We would meet twice a week and have stand up meetings to describe where we were on the project and what help, if any, was needed. We managed the project through GitHub where we decided to utilize merge requests to code review our merges and GitHub issues that we could close as we finished our assignments.
